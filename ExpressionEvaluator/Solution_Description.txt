Parsing

Parsing of input expression is done using StringExpression, which implements simplified version of shunting yard algorigthm.
During parsing object representing each token in the input is created using a factory.
Those objects manipulates ParsingContext, thus creating the resulting parsed expression.
Therefore functionality of parsing new tokens can be added by creating new implementations of AbstractToken and ITokenFactory, which is passed to the constructor.
Parsed expression is returned in form of symbols in reverse polish notation.

Evaluation
Evaluation is done using ParsedExpression class, using algorithm for evaluation of expression in RPN and interpreter pattern.
There is a class for each symbol in the language that either computes corresponding operation or returns a value of a number and changes the EvaluationContext.
Therefore new symbols can be added by implementing AbstractSymbol class.
